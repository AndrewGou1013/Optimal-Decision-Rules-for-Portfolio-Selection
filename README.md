# Optimal-Decision-Rules-for-Portfolio-Selection
In this project, we replicated the "optimal decision rules for portfolio selection" from Robert C. Merton's paper "Lifetime Portfolio Selection under Uncertainty".

We used excess Shiller CAPE yield as a proxy of risky assets' expected excess return, GARCH model to approximate market volatility, and researches conducted by Elm Wealth on investors' degree of risk aversion.
